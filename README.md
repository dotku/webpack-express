# Webpack Express
A boilerplate for webpack and express combination.

## Story Background
There is a [boilerplate](https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate), 
but it doesn't have any update over a year, and the code is kind out of date. I'm 
creating this bolierplate by using newest version of webpack and express alone with 
react as frontend implmentation sample.
